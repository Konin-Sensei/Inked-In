My thoughts about dynamic level traversal. Each number may represent a helper class or transition between two as the enemy moves about. Testing may find more complications.
* = doing
x = done
_ = tbd

x1. we're walking on a platform, check for whether or not we're going to hit an edge and turn if so
x2. if we hit something that makes us stop, turn around
_2.5. see if that thing is jumpable is a stretch goal
x3. make a look for player thingy that depends on direction walking and switch it to chase state 
	_3.5 only switch to chase if player isn't behind something else. (may not be easy to do)
	*3.6 Actually run towards player until hitting the edge of the plat/ink
	_3.7 Check periodically for edge contact
_4. after every jump, check for falling and animate until falling is false
_5. periodically check for plat/ink and use appropriate walk methods //for now, no change but there will be an ink-walk algo
_6. there will eventually be random events throughout a regular patrol session (noises with mouth movements, jumps, eventually complete, random stage-traversal)


_7. Make all other creatures using a better COR breakdown of helpers based on improvements during the chase setup.
