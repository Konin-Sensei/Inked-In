My thoughts about dynamic level traversal. Each number may represent a helper class or transition between two as the enemy moves about. Testing may find more complications.
* = doing
x = done
_ = tbd

x1. we're walking on a platform, check for whether or not we're going to hit an edge and turn if so
x2. if we hit something that makes us stop, turn around
_2.5. see if that thing is jumpable is a stretch goal
x3. make a look for player thingy that depends on direction walking and switch it to chase state 
	_3.5 only switch to chase if player isn't behind something else. (may not be easy to do)
	x3.6 Actually run towards player until hitting the edge of the plat/ink
	x3.7 Check periodically for edge contact
_4. Make a new checkCollisions helper that just sorta lets the brain know if we haven't changed x directions in a while.

*6. Make all other creatures using a better COR breakdown of helpers based on improvements during the chase setup.

*-Make a class for hopping
_-Make a class that checks to see if we're still in the air and only calls hop if that's false, calls the check4Edge otherwise
_-Set the velocity = Vector3 thingy so it just uses a Vector3 constructor with a y var for the y axis and set that y variable to whatever it already is for that body var. that way they fall properly.
