Ricks "docs"
This is just to help me understand and keep in mind all the classes and what their ins and outs are. Should make setting up Jumpers and Flyers easier.

Brain(statePatrol || stateRest|| stateChase) -> switches out active stateChase

Check4Edge("Right" || "Left") -> raycasts in that direction and replies "edge"

checkCollision(job) -> checks if not moving(within reason) and outputs "turn"

Hop("Right" || "Left") -> hops if touching ground

HopDirection("edge" || "turn") -> and returns new direction

Look4Player(job) -> "stateChase"

RunDirection(job) -> "Right" or "Left" depending on players direction.

SwitchState(job[5]) -> take one of 5 and returns one preset string
